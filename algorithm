
timestamp A + B = DATA.stations (last, next)
timestamp now = now marker position on tl
=> temporal progress [0 .. 1]

coordinates position A + B = DATA.stations (last, next)
spatial progress [0 .. 1] = temporal progress
=> coordinates now position
=> set elephant on map

Goal: Elephant should move from one station to the next station, relative to the temporal progress from one event to the next one.
